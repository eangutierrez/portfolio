## Project Overview
* Created a MySQL script to highlight some of the MySQL querying skills I learned while studying _Learning SQL Third Edition_ by Alan Beaulieu.

* Practiced several intermediate and advanced SQL skills, including querying multiple tables, conditional logic, views, common table expressions, and analytic functions.

## Code and Resources Used
**MySQL Version:** 8.0.31
