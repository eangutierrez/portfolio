# Data Analysis Process Stage 6: Act

The last step of the data analysis process is to act on the insights gained during the previous phases. Data analysts present their findings to leadership via PowerPoint presentations, Tableau Dashboards, or other methods. You can find a copy of the completed Tableau Storyboard we created by following [this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tony.gutierrez) to our Tableau Public Profile.

# Stakeholder Recommendations

Now that the clients have access to our Tableau Dashboard, it’s time to provide a set of recommendations based on our findings. These will guide leadership to make data-driven decisions and act on whatever the data shows. Based on the data, the data analytics team has the following set of recommendations:

- First, run advertising campaigns from May through October to convert casual users to members. Any advertising investment during peak season will maximize our product’s exposure to the public and promote customer conversions.

- Second, carry out weekend promotions and events to target new users and inform them of membership benefits. The number of casual users dramatically increases on weekends. Therefore, weekend promotions will increase the audience size.

- Third, target member users to encourage renting bikes for recreational riding to boost profits. The data suggests that member users mostly see our products as a means to commute to school or work. Company profits will grow if we can get member users to use our bikes outside of commuting hours.

As a final recommendation, the data analytics team sees future research opportunities in researching Chicago neighborhood demographics. If we can compare these demographics to the neighborhoods where our bikes are most popular, we can determine what neighborhoods have the best conditions for our company to expand and gain more customers.
